# [RhythMetrix]

Created by Ryan Ramirez and Cindy Nguyen.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, RhythMetrix is for people who want to find new music. It allows users to create a custom playlist based on artists they choose.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Spotify API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
- https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists
  - This will fetch an array of artists which will be filtered based on their associated genre
  - For each artist, I want the `id`, `name` and `images`
- https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{id}/top-tracks
  - This is fetch an object of tracks with their specific infomation
  - For each track, I want the `name of the track`, `artist`, and `images`
- https://api.spotify.com/v1/search/?q=${query}&type=artist
  -   - This will fetch an array of artists based off the search query
  - For each artist, I want the `id` and `name`

This API requires a key which will be fetched through a POST method.

**Example:**
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks](https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists
  - This will fetch an array of artists which will be filtered based on their associated genre
  - For each artist, I want the `id` and `images`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}](https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{id}/top-tracks
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

**Example:**
- On the `/artworks` page, users can view a grid of all artwork

- On the `/artworks/:artworkId` page, users can view additional details for a single piece of art
