# Agile Methodology Reflection

## Prompt 
As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

* Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
* How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
* Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
* What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?

**Write your reflection using markdown**.

## Reflection Response
1. The use of agile practices like stand-ups and scrum boards helped enhance our communication greatly, ensuring we we're on the same page with our progress and encouraging communication even outside these practices. Overall it made the process much smoother than it would have been without it. 
2. The role of the scrum board for our group's organization helped us get kick-started by providing a clear path of priorities. Delegation of tasks was slightly difficult because there was a lack of confidence with React. It would've been ideal to delegate roles based off of strength but in this case, we had to delegate tasks for completion.
3. Our team created a timeline by clearly listing the priorities of each of the tasks, keeping the MVP always towards the top and leaving stretch and styling for the end to ensure that our application functions. This helped us create a functioning application in time.
4. Overall I think our communication would be better if we had already known each-others work style, allowing us to streamline our process more, but this comes with time!
